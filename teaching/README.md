## Programmazione ad Oggetti (LT DIEF)

**Description**

Intermediate course introducing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with the Java language. 
Recommend to learners with previous programming experience.

**Exam**

* Solve 2 exercises from the [learn-java-core](https://github.com/nbicocchi/learn-java-core) repository **(60% weight)**
* Discuss the structure and engineering choices of a home project **(20% weight)**
* Answer general questions about the key topics of the course **(20% weight)**

**Home Project**

* It has to provide value to other learners with insights on either natural phenomena (e.g., fractals-visualization) or the Java ecosystem (e.g., collections-benchmark).
* It has to contain a README.md explaining the project and its internals.
* 250-500 lines of logic code per person, excluding GUI/XML files.
* Use Maven as build tool.
* Refer to [learn-java-javafx](https://github.com/nbicocchi/learn-java-javafx/tree/main/code) for inspiration.

Can we develop the project in groups of 3 people?
> No, you can develop a project alone or with 1 colleague. Groups should be composed of teammates with comparable coding skills. Exceptions to this rule are negatively evaluated.

Can we use JavaScript, TypeScript, Kotlin, Dart, Swift, C++, C#?
> No! Only Java is allowed. 

Can we use external libraries?
> Sure! The object-oriented paradigm has been initially proposed for promoting the reuse of code and building larger projects!

What is the best moment for starting the project?
> The first half of the course concerns basic topics that must be assimilated before starting. My personal suggestion is to start the project around midterm and use the second part of the course to sketch out the main design.

While developing I get strange errors. What should I do?
> The first thing to do is copy and paste the error string on Google and check for eventual answers on StackOverflow. The vast majority of common errors has a dedicated page.

## Distributed Edge Programming (LM DIEF)

**Description**

Advanced course introducing how to design, implement, deploy, and maintain microservice architectures using Java, Spring Framework, Docker and Kubernetes. Recommended to learners with some experience in Java and Distributed Systems.

**Exam**

It is possible to take the final exam at any time, after making arrangements with Dr. Bicocchi. Specifically, the exam is structured as follows:
* A discussion about a home project which has to be related to the key topics of the course. Possible ideas can be found [here](https://github.com/nbicocchi/learn-microservices/blob/main/IDEAS.md). Please discuss your idea to Dr. Bicocchi before starting! **(75% weight)**.
* Some general questions about the key topics of the course. More specifically, students will be asked questions concerning **only** M1.1, M2.1, M3.1, M4.1, M5.1, M6.1, M7.1, M8.1 of [this](https://github.com/nbicocchi/learn-microservices) repository **(25% weight)**.
