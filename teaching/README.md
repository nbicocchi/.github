## Programmazione di Sistema (LT DIEF)

**Description**

Basic course introducing the installation, maintenance, and automation of modern Unix systems using both Bash and the C language.
Recommended to learners without previous experience.

**Exam**

* Solve 1 exercise from the [learn-bash](https://github.com/nbicocchi/learn-bash) repository **(40% weight)**
* Solve 1 exercise from the [learn-c](https://github.com/nbicocchi/learn-c) repository **(40% weight)**
* Answer general questions about the key topics of the course **(20% weight)**

## Programmazione ad Oggetti (LT DIEF)

**Description**

Intermediate course introducing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with the Java language. 
Recommend to learners with previous programming experience.

**Exam**

* Solve 2 exercises from the [learn-java-core](https://github.com/nbicocchi/learn-java-core) repository **(60% weight)**
* Discuss the structure and engineering choices of a home project **(20% weight)**
* Answer general questions about the key topics of the course **(20% weight)**

**Home Project**

* It has to provide value to other learners with insights on either natural phenomena (e.g., fractals-visualization) or the Java ecosystem (e.g., collections-benchmark).
* It has to contain a README.md explaining the project and its internals.
* 250-500 lines of logic code per person, excluding GUI/XML files.
* Use Maven as build tool.
* Refer to [learn-java-javafx](https://github.com/nbicocchi/learn-java-javafx/tree/main/code) for inspiration.

Can we develop the project in groups of 3 people?
> No, you can develop a project alone or with 1 colleague. Groups should be composed of teammates with comparable coding skills. Exceptions to this rule are negatively evaluated.

Can we use JavaScript, TypeScript, Kotlin, Dart, Swift, C++, C#?
> No! Only Java is allowed. 

Can we use external libraries?
> Sure! The object-oriented paradigm has been initially proposed for promoting the reuse of code and building larger projects!

What is the best moment for starting the project?
> The first half of the course concerns basic topics that must be assimilated before starting. My personal suggestion is to start the project around midterm and use the second part of the course to sketch out the main design.

While developing I get strange errors. What should I do?
> The first thing to do is copy and paste the error string on Google and check for eventual answers on StackOverflow. The vast majority of common errors has a dedicated page.

## Distributed Edge Programming (LM DIEF)

**Description**

Advanced course providing a comprehensive introduction to microservices architecture, focusing on building, deploying, and managing scalable distributed systems. The course covers essential topics such as software architecture, containerization, communication (both synchronous and asynchronous), service discovery, resiliency, observability, and DevSecOps. Students will work with tools like Java, Spring Boot, Docker, and JMeter, gaining practical skills in microservice development and orchestration. The course also includes advanced topics like distributed caching, database management in microservices, and automated security testing in DevOps workflows.

**Exam**

You can take the final exam at any time by arranging it with Dr. Bicocchi. The exam consists of the following components:
* One exercise, selected or adapted from the Lab section of each module (50% of the final grade)
* Two questions, selected or adapted from the Lab section of each module (50% of the final grade)

If you're particularly interested in the topic, you also have the option to develop a home project instead of taking the exam.
